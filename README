 	Usage (from controller):
 	========================
 	$this->SendgridEmail->sendEmail($params)
 	
 	$params should be in the following format:
 	
		 *	$params = 
		 *	{
		 *		'to' 			=> <recipient address>,  		REQUIRED - may be array
		 *		'subject 		=> <subject>,					REQUIRED
		 *		'from'			=> <sender address>,  			REQUIRED
		 *		'reply-to'		=> <reply to address>,
		 *		'unique'		=> <unique id for x-SMTPAPI>,
		 *		'category'		=> <category for sendgrid reports>,
		 *		'layout'		=> <email layout filename>,
		 *		'template'		=> <template filename>,
		 *		'layout-type'	=> <[text|html|both]>, 			DEFAULT = both
		 *		'delivery-type'	=> <smtp>,						DEFAULT = smtp
		 *		'merge-values' 	=> array(
		 *			<keys> => <values>,
		 *			<keys> => <values>,..    For doing bulk messages with single call
		 *		)	
		 *	}
		 *
 
 	Installation:
 	=============
 	Copy entire repository into app/controllers/components/ directory
 	
 	Configuration:
 	==============
 	Add $sendgrid configuration to app/config/database.php (as immediately below)
 	
	 	var $sendgrid = array (
			'port'			=> '25', 
			'timeout'		=> '30',
			'host' 			=> 'smtp.sendgrid.net',
			'username'		=> '<your username>',
			'password'		=> '<your password>',
			'client' 		=> 'smtp_helo_hostname',
			'support_email'	=> 'your_administrative_address@domain.com'
		);
	
	The support email address is used as the to-address when sending bulk emails, 
	and does not receive anything, but is needed so that CakePHP does not think that
	and email without a normal SMTP to: address is invalid.

	=================
	Code written and maintained by Dave Loftis.  I am happy to help when and where I can
	but can't promise that I will be able to spend huge amounts of time helping you, 
	but I will offer all the support I can.
	
	Additional features coming soon, including:
	  +  Basic support for SendGrid's EventAPI
	  
	Legacy Users:
	=============
	Poorly planned init() function remains in place.  New code should use sendEmail();
